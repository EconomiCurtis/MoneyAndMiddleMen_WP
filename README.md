`MoneyAndMiddleMen_WP`

This repo provides some of the supporting code and data to generate the figures, tables, and results in "***Emergence of Networks and Market Institutions in a Large Virtual Economy***", currently a working paper by Curtis Kephart, Daniel Friedman, and Matthew Baumer. 

## Data

Original transactions data is currently proprietary, and non-disclosure agreements with Valve Corporation prevent the authors from sharing it broadly, without their explicit premission. We are further limited by the fact that the original dataset was nearly 1-TB in size, making it difficult to share. 

Since most of the figures are derived from aggregated, or otherwise non-individually identifying data, we provide their code here. 

If you have any questions as to how the authors came to their results, or would like to request anythign specific, please do not hesitate to ask.

## Disclosure Statement 

This research was partially funded by Valve Corporation, the University of California Santa Cruz, and LEEPS Lab. Valve Corporation additionally provided technology grants and access to proprietary data.  The authors have non-disclosure agreements with Valve Corporation pertaining to the limited disclosure of proprietary, non-aggregated user data, and trade secrets. These agreements entitle Valve Corporation to review this work before being submitted for publication.
